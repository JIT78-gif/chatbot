"Build a professional, responsive, and modular frontend in React.js (using functional components with hooks) for a Visual Understanding Chat Assistant. This application should integrate with a backend (via n8n webhook) to upload a video, initiate summarization, and support multi-turn conversational AI interactions. The assistant is expected to return initial video summaries and support follow-up queries.
🔧 Functional Requirements:

    Video Upload

        Create a drag-and-drop video upload component.

        Accept video files up to 2 minutes (formats: .mp4, .webm).

        After upload, POST the file to a webhook endpoint (URL placeholder: https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/video).

        Display a progress indicator or spinner while uploading.

    Initial Summary Response

        Once the video is processed, receive and display an assistant-generated summary of events and guideline adherence/violations.

        Show this summary in a styled message bubble as part of the chat history.

    Chat Interface

        Implement a scrollable, persistent chat UI with message bubbles for both user and assistant.

        Messages should show sender (User, Assistant) and timestamp.

        Support multi-turn conversations — maintain chat history and show follow-up answers from assistant.

        Allow users to ask clarifying questions based on the video summary.

    Message Input

        Provide a text box with Enter key and Send button functionality.

        On submit, POST the current chat history and latest user query to a webhook (https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/chat).

        Render assistant reply after receiving it from backend.

💅 UI & UX Design:

    Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure the layout is responsive across desktop and mobile.

    Include subtle animations or loading spinners using Tailwind + Framer Motion or simple CSS.

    Design should include:

        Top Navigation Bar with title/logo.

        Video Upload Area (top card component).

        Chat Window (middle, scrollable).

        Text input field (bottom, fixed).

🔄 State Management:

    Use useState and useEffect for local state.

    Store:

        videoFile

        chatHistory: Array of { sender: 'user' | 'assistant', message: string, timestamp: string }

        isLoading: for video and chat

📦 Backend Integration:

    Upload video to https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/video via multipart/form-data.

    Send chat interactions to https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/chat as application/json:{
  "chat_history": [...],
  "new_message": "user query"
}

    Receive a JSON response like:

{
  "reply": "Assistant response"
}

🔐 Bonus (Optional but Useful):

    Add basic file validation: size, type, and duration.

    Use Toasts for success/error messages.

    Allow resetting the session (clear chat + upload).

🧩 Suggested Components:

    App.jsx: Handles global layout and routing.

    VideoUpload.jsx: Handles video input and upload.

    ChatWindow.jsx: Displays chat messages.

    MessageInput.jsx: Handles user queries.

    ChatMessage.jsx: Individual message UI.

    api.js: Wrapper functions for interacting with the backend.

Please write clean, well-structured, and commented code using modern best practices. Ensure that the app is easy to extend and maintain. Focus on performance, user experience, and maintainability. and also add a command in a code to understand

Visual Understanding Chat Assistant - Core Functionality
Problem Statement
Develop an agentic chat assistant for visual understanding that can process video input,
recognize events, summarize content, and engage in multi-turn conversations. For this
round, the focus is on building a functional prototype that demonstrates the core
features without strict performance constraints.
Objectives
By the end of Round 1, you will have designed and implemented a core system for a
visual understanding agentic chat assistant, demonstrating proficiency in video
processing, event recognition, summarization, and conversational AI.
Features to Implement
● Core Features
■ Video Event Recognition & Summarization w.r.t. Guideline Adherence:
○ The system must accept a video stream as input.
○ It should be capable of identifying specific events within the video.
○ Finally, it should summarize the video content, highlighting key
events and any detected guideline adherence/violations.
○ Example Scenario: Given a traffic scene video, the assistant should
identify vehicle movements, pedestrian crossings, and traffic light
changes, and then summarize traffic violations (e.g., "Vehicle X ran
a red light at timestamp Y," "Pedestrian crossed against the signal
at timestamp Z").
■ Multi-Turn Conversations:
○ The chat assistant must support natural, multi-turn interactions
with the user. This means it should retain context from previous
turns to understand follow-up questions and provide coherent
responses.
○ An agentic workflow is preferred.
○ Users should be able to ask clarifying questions or further inquire
about events/summaries generated from the video.
■ Video Input Processing:
○ The system must be able to process an input video stream with a
maximum duration of 2 minutes.
Choice of Tools
● Backend Tech Stack: You have the freedom to choose any backend technology
stack. Justify your choice based on its suitability for AI/ML workloads and
scalability.
● VLM/AI Models: You may use any open-source or closed-source models and
APIs. The primary goal is to achieve the core functionality effectively.
Deliverables
By the end of the round, submit the following:
● Source Code: A well-organized and commented codebase for your chat
assistant. Push the source code to GitHub and add
https://github.com/MantraHackathon to the repository.
● README.md File: A comprehensive README file including:
■ Project Overview: A brief description of your solution.
■ Architecture Diagram: A high-level diagram illustrating the components of
your system and their interactions.
■ Tech Stack Justification: Explanation for your chosen backend
technologies and AI models.
■ Setup and Installation Instructions: Clear steps to get the project running.
■ Usage Instructions: How to interact with the chat assistant, including
examples of video input and conversational queries.
● Demo Video : A short video demonstrating the features of your chat assistant.
Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
● Functionality: How well the core features (video event recognition,
summarization, multi-turn conversations) are implemented.
● Code Quality: Readability, modularity, comments, and adherence to good coding
practices.
● System Design: The clarity and robustness of your architectural design.
● Documentation: Completeness and clarity of your README.md file.
● Innovation/Creativity: Any unique approaches that enhance the assistant's
