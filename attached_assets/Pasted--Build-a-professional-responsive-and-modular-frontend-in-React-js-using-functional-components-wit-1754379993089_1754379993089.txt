"Build a professional, responsive, and modular frontend in React.js (using functional components with hooks) for a Visual Understanding Chat Assistant. This application should integrate with a backend (via n8n webhook) to upload a video, initiate summarization, and support multi-turn conversational AI interactions. The assistant is expected to return initial video summaries and support follow-up queries.
üîß Functional Requirements:

    Video Upload

        Create a drag-and-drop video upload component.

        Accept video files up to 2 minutes (formats: .mp4, .webm).

        After upload, POST the file to a webhook endpoint (URL placeholder: https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/video).

        Display a progress indicator or spinner while uploading.

    Initial Summary Response

        Once the video is processed, receive and display an assistant-generated summary of events and guideline adherence/violations.

        Show this summary in a styled message bubble as part of the chat history.

    Chat Interface

        Implement a scrollable, persistent chat UI with message bubbles for both user and assistant.

        Messages should show sender (User, Assistant) and timestamp.

        Support multi-turn conversations ‚Äî maintain chat history and show follow-up answers from assistant.

        Allow users to ask clarifying questions based on the video summary.

    Message Input

        Provide a text box with Enter key and Send button functionality.

        On submit, POST the current chat history and latest user query to a webhook (https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/chat).

        Render assistant reply after receiving it from backend.

üíÖ UI & UX Design:

    Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensure the layout is responsive across desktop and mobile.

    Include subtle animations or loading spinners using Tailwind + Framer Motion or simple CSS.

    Design should include:

        Top Navigation Bar with title/logo.

        Video Upload Area (top card component).

        Chat Window (middle, scrollable).

        Text input field (bottom, fixed).

üîÑ State Management:

    Use useState and useEffect for local state.

    Store:

        videoFile

        chatHistory: Array of { sender: 'user' | 'assistant', message: string, timestamp: string }

        isLoading: for video and chat

üì¶ Backend Integration:

    Upload video to https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/video via multipart/form-data.

    Send chat interactions to https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com/chat as application/json:{
  "chat_history": [...],
  "new_message": "user query"
}

    Receive a JSON response like:

{
  "reply": "Assistant response"
}

üîê Bonus (Optional but Useful):

    Add basic file validation: size, type, and duration.

    Use Toasts for success/error messages.

    Allow resetting the session (clear chat + upload).

üß© Suggested Components:

    App.jsx: Handles global layout and routing.

    VideoUpload.jsx: Handles video input and upload.

    ChatWindow.jsx: Displays chat messages.

    MessageInput.jsx: Handles user queries.

    ChatMessage.jsx: Individual message UI.

    api.js: Wrapper functions for interacting with the backend.

Please write clean, well-structured, and commented code using modern best practices. Ensure that the app is easy to extend and maintain. Focus on performance, user experience, and maintainability. and also add a command in a code to understand

Visual Understanding Chat Assistant - Core Functionality
Problem Statement
Develop an agentic chat assistant for visual understanding that can process video input,
recognize events, summarize content, and engage in multi-turn conversations. For this
round, the focus is on building a functional prototype that demonstrates the core
features without strict performance constraints.
Objectives
By the end of Round 1, you will have designed and implemented a core system for a
visual understanding agentic chat assistant, demonstrating proficiency in video
processing, event recognition, summarization, and conversational AI.
Features to Implement
‚óè Core Features
‚ñ† Video Event Recognition & Summarization w.r.t. Guideline Adherence:
‚óã The system must accept a video stream as input.
‚óã It should be capable of identifying specific events within the video.
‚óã Finally, it should summarize the video content, highlighting key
events and any detected guideline adherence/violations.
‚óã Example Scenario: Given a traffic scene video, the assistant should
identify vehicle movements, pedestrian crossings, and traffic light
changes, and then summarize traffic violations (e.g., "Vehicle X ran
a red light at timestamp Y," "Pedestrian crossed against the signal
at timestamp Z").
‚ñ† Multi-Turn Conversations:
‚óã The chat assistant must support natural, multi-turn interactions
with the user. This means it should retain context from previous
turns to understand follow-up questions and provide coherent
responses.
‚óã An agentic workflow is preferred.
‚óã Users should be able to ask clarifying questions or further inquire
about events/summaries generated from the video.
‚ñ† Video Input Processing:
‚óã The system must be able to process an input video stream with a
maximum duration of 2 minutes.
Choice of Tools
‚óè Backend Tech Stack: You have the freedom to choose any backend technology
stack. Justify your choice based on its suitability for AI/ML workloads and
scalability.
‚óè VLM/AI Models: You may use any open-source or closed-source models and
APIs. The primary goal is to achieve the core functionality effectively.
Deliverables
By the end of the round, submit the following:
‚óè Source Code: A well-organized and commented codebase for your chat
assistant. Push the source code to GitHub and add
https://github.com/MantraHackathon to the repository.
‚óè README.md File: A comprehensive README file including:
‚ñ† Project Overview: A brief description of your solution.
‚ñ† Architecture Diagram: A high-level diagram illustrating the components of
your system and their interactions.
‚ñ† Tech Stack Justification: Explanation for your chosen backend
technologies and AI models.
‚ñ† Setup and Installation Instructions: Clear steps to get the project running.
‚ñ† Usage Instructions: How to interact with the chat assistant, including
examples of video input and conversational queries.
‚óè Demo Video : A short video demonstrating the features of your chat assistant.
Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
‚óè Functionality: How well the core features (video event recognition,
summarization, multi-turn conversations) are implemented.
‚óè Code Quality: Readability, modularity, comments, and adherence to good coding
practices.
‚óè System Design: The clarity and robustness of your architectural design.
‚óè Documentation: Completeness and clarity of your README.md file.
‚óè Innovation/Creativity: Any unique approaches that enhance the assistant's
